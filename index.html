            Hello! My name is <strong>Peter Kallos</strong>. I'm a
            <em>fourth year</em> computer science student at
            <strong>Cal Poly</strong> with a strong interest in software
            development and all things technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of school and programming, I enjoy playing soccer, guitar,
            exercising, and photography.
